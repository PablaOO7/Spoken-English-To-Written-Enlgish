# Spoken-English-To-Written-Enlgish

DeepSpeech 
This project is made by Mozilla; The organization behind the Firefox browser. Itâ€™s a 100% free and open source speech-to-text library that also implies the machine learning technology using TensorFlow framework to fulfill its mission.
In other words, you can use it to build training models yourself to enhance the underlying speech-to-text technology and get better results, or even to bring it to other languages if you want. You can also easily integrate it to your other machine learning projects that you are having on TensorFlow. Sadly it sounds like the project is currently only supporting English by default.

Rest for the rules i am still figuring out which model and algorithms to use.
